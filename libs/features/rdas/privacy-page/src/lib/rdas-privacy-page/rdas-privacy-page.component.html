                Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies</a> allows federal agencies to
              use session and persistent cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a “cookie” to place on your
              computer. The cookie allows the server to “remember” specific information about your visit while you are
              connected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies from NCATS Web pages
              only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect personal information
              about you.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two types of cookies, single-session (temporary) and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies
              last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
              Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.
            </p>
            <p>
              Session Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes, such as to enable better navigation
              through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB
              memo 10-22 guidance defines use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1—Single Session.” The policy says,
              “This tier encompasses any use of single session Web measurement and customization technologies.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Persistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and
              returning ncats.nih.gov visitors. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to this
              website until they expire. The OMB memo 10-22 guidance defines use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier
              2—Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, “This tier
              encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is
              collected.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Opt-Out or Disable Cookies: If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your
              computer, you can disable them using your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have
              access to all information and resources at ncats.nih.gov. Find
